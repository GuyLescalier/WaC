Yes, you can use Nexus Repository Manager OSS (Open Source Software) to create a NuGet hosted repository for storing your PowerShell modules. Nexus supports hosting your own NuGet packages, which makes it suitable for private distribution of software, including PowerShell modules. Here's how to set it up and use it for your PowerShell modules:

### Setting Up a NuGet Hosted Repository in Nexus

1. **Create the Repository**:

    - Log in to your Nexus Repository Manager.
    - Navigate to the Administration section and look for Repository or Repositories under the Repository group.
    - Choose "Repositories" and click on the "Create repository" button.
    - Select "nuget (hosted)" as the recipe.
    - Configure the repository:
        - **Name**: Give your repository a meaningful name.
        - **Version Policy**: Choose "Mixed" to allow both release and snapshot versions, if needed.
        - **Storage**: Configure storage settings as necessary, including blob store and strict content type validation.
    - Save the configuration.

2. **Configure API Key** (optional but recommended for publishing):
    - NuGet clients require an API Key to publish packages. You can generate this from your development machine using NuGet or dotnet CLI tools and then configure it in Nexus if needed.

### Publishing PowerShell Modules to Nexus

To publish your PowerShell module as a NuGet package to Nexus, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Module**:
    - Ensure your PowerShell module is structured correctly with a `.psd1` manifest and other necessary files.
    - Create a `.nuspec` file for your module, which NuGet uses to define package metadata.
2. **Build the NuGet Package**:

    - Use the `nuget pack` command to create a `.nupkg` file from your module directory, where your `.nuspec` file is located.

    ```bash
    nuget pack YourModule.nuspec
    ```

3. **Publish the Package**:
    - Use the `nuget push` command to publish the `.nupkg` file to your Nexus repository. You'll need the URL of your NuGet hosted repository and your API Key (if configured).
    ```bash
    nuget push YourModule.nupkg -Source "http://your-nexus-server/repository/your-nuget-repo/" -ApiKey yourApiKey
    ```

### Configuring PowerShell to Use Your Nexus Repository

1. **Register the Repository with PowerShellGet**:

    - Use `Register-PSRepository` to add your Nexus NuGet repository to the list of available repositories.

    ```powershell
    Register-PSRepository -Name "MyPrivateRepo" -SourceLocation "http://your-nexus-server/repository/your-nuget-repo/" -PublishLocation "http://your-nexus-server/repository/your-nuget-repo/" -InstallationPolicy Trusted
    ```

2. **Find and Install Modules**:
    - Use `Find-Module` and `Install-Module` with the `-Repository` parameter to install modules from your Nexus repository.
    ```powershell
    Find-Module -Repository MyPrivateRepo
    Install-Module -Name YourModuleName -Repository MyPrivateRepo
    ```

By setting up a NuGet hosted repository in Nexus for your PowerShell modules, you create a private, centralized location for module distribution within your organization, leveraging Nexus's management features and the familiar PowerShellGet commands for module installation and updates.
